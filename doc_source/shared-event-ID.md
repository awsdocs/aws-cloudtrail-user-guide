# sharedEventID Example<a name="shared-event-ID"></a>

The following is an example that describes how CloudTrail delivers two events for the same action:

1.  Alice has AWS account \(111111111111\) and creates a customer master key \(CMK\)\. She is the owner of this CMK\. 

1.  Bob has AWS account \(222222222222\)\. Alice gives AWS account \(222222222222\)\ permission to use the CMK\. 

1.  Each account has a trail and a separate bucket\.

1.  Bob calls the `Encrypt` API specifying Alice's CMK\. 

1.  CloudTrail sends two separate events\. 
   + One event is sent to Bob\. The event shows that he used the CMK\.
   + One event is sent to Alice\. The event shows that Bob used the CMK\.
   + The events have the same `sharedEventID`, but the `eventID` and `recipientAccountID` are unique\.
